# Guessing-Game
 This is a Guessing Game project i made because i was bored and i wanted to play a game with my younger siblings

 # How it works
 -Tells the host or player1 to input a number and it clears so that player 2 will not see player1's number
 -Then it says if player2 got the number correctly
 Example:
 Player1: 4
 Player2: 5
 Wrong!
